<p>This application was created using Meteor. It can be used to make, save and update grocery lists. Once the user is in the store, they can use it to check off items on the list, put in the price and see the total, with tax.<br>
Users can also save their previous lists to either reuse them, or compare current prices to previous ones.<br>
Future implementations of this page would also allow the user to change the tax rate depending on their location, and include coupons and other discounts in the pricing.</p>
